# Acoustic survey

## Why use acoustic survey methods?

Birds create species-specific songs and calls that can be readily recorded using automated or handheld recording systems.

Passive audio recordings can be long-term, pre-programmed to record during certain periods and over many days/weeks (i.e. SM4 recorders, Audiomoths or, Swift Bioacoustics recorders), or, over a shorter time frame (i.e. a Dictaphone during walk over survey).

Such devices allow acoustic surveys to be undertaken for extended periods of time, with data being saved for later analysis using machine learning techniques and/or human assessors. 

Species detection rate is commonly associated with sampling effort, e.g. the number of survey visits, and the duration of each survey. As PAM can easily expand this capability, it can provide improved survey outcomes and a better representation of the species assemblage at a site [@Darras2019; @Melo2021].

The benefits of using automated recording, especially alongside traditional surveys, are well documented in scientific research (see Box 1). In particular, the ability to produce a standardised, long-duration, permanent dataset, which can be repeatedly analysed, and subject to quality assurance checks, is a major advantage over standard field surveys (Darras *et al*. 2018). There are some disadvantages – principally the lack of visual cues that would be used by a human surveyor in the field, and the fact that the static bioacoustic approach does not lend itself to preparing the territory maps often used in bird assessments (see Box 2). However, depending on the aims of the survey, bioacoustics methods have many advantages. For example, Zwart *et al*. (2015) found that acoustic recorders offered a 217% increase in nightjar *Caprimulgus europaeus* detection over human surveyors, (with 19 detections in 22 survey periods compared to 6 detections by humans). With these recognised benefits, the use of automated recorders in scientific research has increased significantly over the last ten years

Several studies have compared point-count data to automated acoustic recording in a variety of habitats such as rainforest (Leach *et al*. 2016), tropical savanna (Alquezar and Machado 2015), temperate woodlands (Holmes *et al*. 2014, Furnas and Callas 2015), and temperate meadows (Tegeler *et al*. 2012). These have shown that the results are comparable in terms of species-richness and bird assemblage composition when used for equivalent lengths of time. However, automated recording can easily provide larger amounts of data than human surveyors, often with less survey effort (Holmes *et al*. 2014). For example, Tegeler *et al*. (2012) gained >1,100 additional hours of data using automated recorders, and recorded more species with a quarter of the personnel effort. Using both methods together often provides the best overall results as their respective strengths and weaknesses are complementary (Klingbeil and Willig 2015, Shonfield and Bayne 2017).

## When to use acoustic survey methods

Acoustic survey techniques should be considered for any bird survey programme, but especially under any one of the following circumstances:

- The presence of priority nocturnal species (e.g. nightjar, long-eared owl, nightingale);
- When surveys are required to prove the presence of a particular species on site, especially where densities may be low or behaviour is cryptic (e.g. nightingale, skylark, willow tit, water rail);
- To identify the extent of nocturnal migration over a site;
- To identify the presence of nocturnal site usage of a particular aspect or habitat (i.e. foraging waders or wildfowl); or,
- Where difficult terrain prevents effective survey access  (e.g. warblers in reed bed or dense scrub).
- Where information on termporal trends is needed, e.g. daily or seasonal patterns in occupancy or numbers.

These circumstances should also be used to determine the location and duration of a recording session.



## Integrating acoustic and standard survey methods

Using acoustic methods alongside standard surveys can provide the best of both worlds. It will provide both spatial information, and data on non-vocalizing species, from the walkover surveys, combined with the longer-term recordings from a number of days and nights of recording.



## How to use acoustic recording methods

### 1. Survey effort and timing

> Recommendations: 
>
> Surveys should include a minimum of two deployments, in April to mid-May, and mid-May to end of June.
>
> A minimum of three days recording per deployment.
>
> Recordings should cover both dawn and dusk periods. This should cover a minimum of one hour before sunrise until two hours after, and an hour either side of sunset.
>
> To minimise data volume and analytical requirements, a time-sampling approach should be used. This should use frequent short recordings, e.g. a one minute sample (or shorter) taken every ten minutes.

**Rationale**

The recording and data volume requirements of any survey will vary depending on the project objectives and the species concerned (Bayne *et al*. 2017). The seasonal programme and daily timing of recording need to be considered, to maximise the long-term data capture benefits of automated recorders, whilst avoiding an overwhelming data mountain (Klingbeil and Willig 2015).

Discontinuous time-sampling approach recording has been repeatedly been shown to significantly reduce data volume with only minimal reductions in capture of species richness. Scientific studies have found that a stratified ‘on-off’ time sampling programme (e.g. recording 1 minute in every 10), can capture comparable data to continuous recording, with consequent benefits in terms of battery life, data storage and processing time (La and Nudds 2016, Bayne *et al*. 2017). 

Bird detection probability normally varies with time of the day, so recording times distributed throughout the day will sample the entire community most effectively (La and Nudds 2016). This is especially the case when recording is focused on the main dawn and evening chorus times. With prices reducing and availability of data storage increasing, continuous recording, that can be sub- sampled later in the processing stage, is also a realistic option for fieldwork.

**Supporting evidence**

@Wimmer2013 found that 120 one-minute recordings, randomly selected from the three hours following sunrise, was the most efficient way to detect the highest number of species from a five-day recording period.

@Franklin2021 studied bird assemblages in eucalypt forests, and recommended an optimal survey method of five 20-min sampling periods immediately following dawn for 2 days.

@Metcalf2021 found that if time-sampling approach is being used, then shorter file lengths (i.e. one minute or less) are far better than longer recordings. For example, instead of 4 x 15 minute samples across a three-hour period, then 240 x 15 second samples produces faster species accumulation and greater species richness.

@Wood2021 showed from simulations and case studies that a 50% reduction in overall recording duration may only result in a 5%–17% decrease in the detected species richness of the assemblage present. In terms of outcome per unit of effort, there was an increase in performance for 3 days/continuous (12 hr total) and 3 days/every-other 5 min (6 hr) scenarios compared to  7 days/every other 5 min (14 hr) and 7 days/15 min per hour (7hr) scenarios.

@Cook2018 compared a continuous five-minute audio recording with an intermittent sample, using 30 x ten-second samples from a 30 minute period to create a five-minute composite recording. A significantly greater number of species were detected with the latter method.

Similarly,

>
> Thompson et al. (2017) recommend that having more recordings of shorter duration (1–4 minutes) is more efficient than fewer recordings of 10 minutes duration.

###2. Recorder placement

> Recommendations: 
>
> Use a regular grid-based or stratified random sampling system across the survey area, with a minimum distance between sampling locations of 250 m. 
>
> Recorders should be located 1-2 m from the ground, on tripods, narrow poles or trees <0.2 m diameter, avoiding branches/leaves around the unit as far as possible.

**Rationale**

For coverage of a site, the aim should be to sample across the range of the habitats and species of interest, with recorders placed to limit overlap of detection radii so that counts are independent (O’Donnell and Williams 2015). The effective radius of most recorders is in the region of 50 m, so a minimum separation distance of at least 100 m should be used (Yip *et al*. 2017).

As a recommended standard, a larger 250 m spacing between recorder locations would provide 16 sampling locations/km2. This is dense enough to provide a good level of survey data, and is also likely to be relevant to the territory sizes of bird species of interest within ecological assessments. However, alternative separation distances between 100-500 m could also be used, depending on survey requirements.

When placing recorders in the field, omnidirectional microphones should be used, located horizontally 1-2 m from the ground (or higher if security is an issue), and in a mounting position that does not block the field of sound or increase the levels of background noise from wind and water (Klingbeil and Willig 2015, La and Nudds, 2016).

**Supporting evidence**

@Perez-Granados2019 simulated the requirements for recorder layout on Dupont's Lark, and found that within a 100ha (= 1km2) survey area and at a density of 1 male/10 ha, four ARUs (= 500m spacing) were sufficient to detect species presence with 90% of confidence (Figure 3).

@Symes2022 performed a simulation to test trade-offs between recording at more sites, or for longer durations, when total sampling time was the same. Adding locations resulted in more species per unit of analysis effort than adding more days, e.g.  species detection saturated at 30 species when sampling in one location and at 41 species when the same sampling duration was spread was across ten sites.

### 3. Recording equipment

> Recommendations: 
>
> Commercially available, off-the-shelf, single recorder units should be used to provide consistency in data collected between different studies. 
>
> The recorder should be a programmable, automated unit, using omnidirectional acoustic microphones, with a flat response across the range of audible frequencies. 
>
> Recorder and microphones should be individually numbered, checked and calibrated on a regular basis (at least once per year).

**Rationale**

There are many options in terms of recording equipment, but the best current approach uses off-the-shelf, single recorder units, which incorporate a microphone, circuitry, power source and recording media in a single unit. Examples of this are the Wildlife Acoustics Song Meters, Cornell Labs Swift or AudioMoth. These are both scaleable and easily available to a range of users.

Recorder model, microphone type, and settings should be standardised across a study and carefully recorded in metadata. Microphone management, calibration and checking is very important before and after field deployments, as degradation in microphone quality over time can significantly affect results.

**Supporting evidence**

> @Darras2018: For audio point counts, we suggest recording all audible sound in uncompressed audio formats (sampling frequency: 44.1 kHz, WAV or FLAC audio file format). Our results support the positive effect of the number of microphones (Table [3](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-tbl-0003)), and to mimic the human auditory system, two microphones should be used. They should be omni-directional to avoid sampling only a part of the sampling area like in Haselmayer and Quinn ([2000](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-bib-0022)), even though microphones cannot be perfectly omni-directional. To sample a sound detection space as large as possible, they should be directed to the sound sources of interest: parallel to the ground (horizontally except on slopes) and pointing in opposite directions. In line with our results (Table [3](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-tbl-0003)), microphones should be placed at 1.5–2 m height (i.e. similar height as most human observers ears) to maximize the sound detection space and stay out of sound shadows. It is not yet known whether higher installation heights would be beneficial, but they would be more difficult to implement and might make it more difficult to jointly analyse data from both recording systems and human observers. Trees are often used as installation poles; however, microphones should not be close to their trunk to avoid impeding sound transmission. Separating the microphones by approximately 25 cm would yield results most comparable to human point counts, and also ensure the best sound source localization (Maxon & Mazor, [1977](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-bib-0035)), useful for getting a spatial image of the soundscape and for estimating bird detection distances in sound recordings (Darras, Furnas et al., [2018](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-bib-0013)). Defining more exact measures would be impractical and have only little effect on the audio quality. The effective sampling range should not be limited by the microphone's self-noise, which turned out to be a critical predictor and often under-appreciated aspect of sound recorder performance (Table [3](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-tbl-0003)), we thus recommend a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of 72 dB, corresponding to the lowest value of microphones that were deemed to perform similar to humans (Hobson et al., [2002](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-bib-0026)). However, the measurement protocols for signal-to-noise ratios may vary, so that when possible, one should aim for maximal signal-to-noise ratios around 80 dB (Figure [2](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-fig-0002)). Microphones should be regularly checked to ensure that they perform satisfyingly as their performance declines with time (Turgeon et al., [2017](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13229#jpe13229-bib-0056)).

### 4. Audio settings

> Recommendations: 
>
> Recordings should be made as non- compressed .WAV files, with a sample rate of 44.1 or 48 kHz and 16-bit depth or greater. Lower sample rates. e.g. 24 kHz may be used, especially when surveying for lower-frequency bird species (e.g. bittern) to save on storage capacity. 
>
> Before deployment, ensure that hardware and software settings are recorded and standardised across all units.

**Rationale**

For good quality audio data, a non- compressed digital file format (i.e. .WAV rather than MP3) should be used. If possible, recordings should be in stereo using a sample rate of 48 kHz and 24-bit depth (although 44.1 kHz and 16-bit depth is acceptable). These settings will cover the entire audible range, producing detailed data on frequency and amplitude to produce clear spectrograms and analysis information. If, however, the study is focussed on particular target species, with lower frequency calls, then a lower sample rate can be used to save on storage and battery life.

**5. Metadata recording**

> Recommendatuon: At the start of each deployment, record the date/time, surveyor name, sampling location and recorder/microphone identifiers. Photographs of location and set-up should be taken. Weather conditions during the survey period should also be recorded.

**Rationale**

With each survey deployment, appropriate metadata including location, dates/times, weather, habitat and equipment identifiers should be recorded. This can be done using paper/tablet, or by speaking into microphones while they are recording, so the metadata becomes part of the recorded data itself. This background data is clearly needed to accurately organise and archive recordings, and can be used for any detailed analysis of how environmental characteristics determine the bird acoustic assemblage. It is also important to make acoustic data as comparable as possible across different surveys, allowing use
 in larger-scale monitoring projects and contributions to databases.

# Analysing and storing acoustic data

> Recommendations: 
>
> Identify the presence/absence of each species in one minute audio samples and calculate the proportion of samples in which each species is recorded. Provide a summary of species observations per day or sampling event. 
>
> If using any automated recogniser or clustering process, then the error rates should be checked and reported so that the quality of the recogniser can be properly assessed.

**Rationale**

Data collected through acoustic monitoring techniques should be checked by experienced ornithologists, familiar with bird vocalisations and species distribution/behaviour.

The analysis of data gained from acoustic recorders is perhaps the most difficult
 area in which to make standardised recommendations. A range of software is available to manipulate, view and analyse acoustic recordings (e.g. Kaleidoscope, Raven, Audacity, Luscinia and packages in R), some of which allow the clustering or automated recognition of bird calls (Figure 3). However, much scientific research has simply relied upon ornithologists listening to audio files and viewing spectrograms. At present, a human-supervised semi- automated process probably offers the best balance between accuracy of call classification and time required for analysis. Whichever method is used, the data analysis protocol should be fully described, and identification error rates calculated, providing metrics such as precision and recall if a recogniser has been used (Knight *et al*. 2017). The simple and robust metric of call activity, as set out in Box 3, will provide a species list for each sampling location, together with the relative vocal activity levels for each species. This presents a basic assessment of the data and will allow comparability between different studies. (Bayne *et al*. 2017).

Audio recordings of rare and priority species should be stored for review at a later date and archived with county recorders/research organisations, and online, open-source bird call repositories (i.e. xeno-canto).

Passive recording for species specific surveys can only prove presence on site and does not confirm absence
